## What is McDatascript?
Datascript is a project that attempts to make minecraft datapacks easy to write. Far-Fetched? I don't know, but I'm gonna do it anyway.

## The Goal
The goal is to make a custom file format (.mcds currently) that can be interpreted by an executable, which will make a functional Minecraft datapack out of your code.

### Ideas/What will it be like?
The plan is to make a javascript-style language that is easy to understand. Implementations will include:
 * Variables
 * Comments
 * Mathematical and bitwise operations
 * Player and entity targeting, similar to the vanilla system
 * Block, item, and text display support
 * Data modification

## Conclusion
While it may be an ambitious project, but I beleive that it will happen, and that it will hopefully be executed well.
